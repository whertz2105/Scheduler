Scheduler Web Page
==================

Open `index.html` in a web browser to manage your weekly schedule.
Use the buttons at the top of the page to add or remove employees,
assign additional positions or pay rates, and create new shifts.
The right side of the page lists every employee with their positions
and pay rates. After assigning employees and entering projected sales,
click **Calculate** to view labor costs and percentages. The "Labor
$/hr" rows show the sum of hourly pay rates for all assigned employees
in the AM and PM sections, while "Projected Labor ($)" shows total
costs for each day.
